            <p> <h3>Philosophy </h3>


                My teaching philosophy includes:
                <ul>
                    <li>open mindedness</li>
                    <li>positive attitude</li>
                    <li>equal chances</li>
                    <li>high expectations</li> <!--in the classroom -->
                </ul> <br>
                Education should be encouraging, relevant to the studentsâ€™ lives, 
                intellectually challenging and should be designed
                to bring out the maximum potential from the students. 
                Each classroom is dynamically different, 
                but incorporating different teaching tools and strategies can engage, 
                motivate and activate students. I always strive to bring my maximum 
                to the classrooms as I believe I owe this to my students and the community.
